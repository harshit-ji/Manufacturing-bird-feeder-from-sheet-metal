# Manufacturing-bird-feeder-from-sheet-metal
This project was the induction task for the CAE to induct the new club members. In this we had to 
design a bird feeder in any 3d modelling software. Top five designs were chosen and their designers 
were inducted into the club. After the induction, among those five designs, one was chosen to be 
manufactured as the bird feeder for the campus. My design was chosen for this purpose and then we 
had to manufacture 7 bird feeders from that design using sheet metal
